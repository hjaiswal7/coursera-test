                 Skater style is all about wearing comfortable, movable and functional clothing. These loose-fitting shorts are unrestrictive and perfect for trying out some tricks. Pair them with an oversized T-shirt and a bucket hat that not only looks super stylish but also shades the face. The most important part of skater style is the shoes, and you can’t go wrong with a pair of Vans.
